Install and run
---------------

Make sure you have run install.sh to have several soft links configured as required
and also installed the necessary libs

Build sample app
----------------

You may write your applications using the client.
Please see getting started with client at bangdb.com/developer

However you may simply get started by building the sample app provided here

Following steps would help;

A. link with the bangdb-embd-cpp only
B. include the headers in the include folder

that's it!
You may use following to build sample.cpp and run [ pls do start server before running it ]

compile ....
	javac -cp .:../../jars/bangdb-embd-java.jar:.../../jars/json-20190722.jar test/Main.java test/Sample.java

run...
	java -cp .:../../jars/bangdb-embd-java.jar:../../jars/json-20190722.jar -Djava.library.path="/usr/local/lib"  test.Main

Note: bangdb.config is required to run any app (keep in the same folder as exe)

Use the detail API and dev section at the bangdb.com

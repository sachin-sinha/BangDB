Make sure you have run the install.sh to have several soft links configured as required
and also installed the necessary libs

Build sample app
----------------

Please see getting started with client at bangdb.com/developer

However you may simply get started by building the sample app provided here

Following steps would help;

A. link with the libbangdb-embd-cpp only
B. include the headers in the include folder

that's it!
You may use following to build sample.cpp and run [ pls do start server before running it ]

compile ....
	g++ -O3 -Wall sample.cpp -osample -I/usr/local/include/bangdb-embd -lbangdb-embd-cpp

run...
	./sample

Note: bangdb.config is required to run any app (keep in the same folder as exe)

Use the detail API and dev section at the bangdb.com
